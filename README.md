# ESP8266 MQTT Thermal Printer for HA
This project is fork from [ESP8266 MQTT Thermal Printer](https://github.com/HutchieV/ESP8266-MQTT-Thermal-Printer) and a I really would like to thatnk original author for it.

Here I'll try to improve it to the best of my abilities for specific use - adding it to [Home Assistant] as printer for anything that wou want to print from it.

Although COMPLETELY unnecessary, this printer is really fun addtion to it allowing you to expand your system output options and it would be great to have it in future as part of the notification platform. BUT that is out of my (I'l just a sales guy tinkering) programming capabilities.

# About printer

This [58mm Thermal Printer](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AZ8OYO) can print by using USB/TTL connection.
In the package you will receive power cable and data cable.
It has preloaded firmware with Latin alphabet (ASCII) but also has capability to print Bar Code (something I still havent test) and 2D Bar code.
Yes, if you know how to convert, pritner can also print very simple images.

Paper needs to be 57.5mm (58 is ok) and there are even [sticker version](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001877510938.html), which opens up some more capabilites.
